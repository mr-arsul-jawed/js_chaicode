# Javascript and classes
- Technically, JavaScript does not have "real" classes like Java or C++.
Instead, JavaScript classes are just syntactical sugar over prototypes. This means classes in JavaScript are a cleaner way to work with objects and prototypes, but under the hood, JavaScript still uses prototype-based inheritance.

## OOP 

## object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase
- toUpperCase

## why use OOP
- OOP is used because it makes programming more structured, reusable, and maintainable.
1: Code Reusability (Inheritance)
2: Better Data Security (Encapsulation)
3: Flexibility & Scalability (Polymorphism)
## parts of OOP
Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 Pillars
1: Abstraction - Hides complex implementation and shows only the essential details.

2: Encapsualtion - Wrapping data and methods together in a single unit(class) and Protects data from direct access (data hiding).

3: Inheritance - Inheritance allows a child class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class.

4: Polymorphism - Polymorphism allows a method to behave differently depending on the object that calls it.


##         PROTOTYPES 


## This draw means array is object or string is object also function is object.
          function
             |
Array ---> Object <------ string
             |
            null
